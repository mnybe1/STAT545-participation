*__A brief about me:__ I moved to Vancouver from Tasmania, Australia in May 2019. I'm studying my MSc in geography, focusing on the effects of land use and climate change on carbon cycling in wetlands. More generally I'm interested in climate change and other anthropogenic effects on ecosystem processes. Hobbies include hiking, generally just being outdoors, cooking!*
